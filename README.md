# 🟠 OrangeHRM Test Automation (Selenium + Java)

## 📖 Overview
This is my personal automation framework built with **Selenium WebDriver** and **Java**.  
I’m using the [OrangeHRM demo site](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/) as the application under test to practice automation concepts.

⚠️ The project is still in an **early stage of development**.  

Currently, it contains:
- 🧩 Basic **Page Object Model** setup  
- ✅ A sample **end-to-end login test**  
- 🔄 First steps toward a **reusable test structure**
